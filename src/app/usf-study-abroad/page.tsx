          USFâ€™s Study Abroad department wanted to make a cookbook. They needed a digital platform where students could share their own cultural stories and recipes together.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          For this project, we needed a way for users to view, make, and sort through posts easilyâ€“much like a blog-forum hybrid.
          Framer was the top choice for a straightforward CMS + robust design capabilities.

          Cookbooks heavily rely on images in order to encourage viewers to follow a recipe.
          For the homepage, we decided to use cards with visuals to prioritize the imagesâ€“they would help drive users towards the recipes they found most yummy-looking.

          Recipes could be easily uploaded to the website via a simple automation. 
          First, we collected recipes (images + copy) in a specific format through a Google form. 
          The forms were fed into a Google sheet, which Zapier then sent to Framerâ€™s CMS. 
          Recipe pages were automatically ready for the site moderators to review and edit inside of Framer before publishing.
