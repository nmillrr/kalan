          WeHa Washes is an established small business specializing in mobile car washes and detailing. 
          As they began scaling over the years, they needed a digital platform to centralize their business information and streamline customer intake.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We built an efficient, user-friendly website that followed an intuitive hierarchy of information. 
          Both prospects and customers were able to better understand the scope of services, 
          see before/after detailing photos, and most importantly, schedule appointments online.

          Previously, WeHa Washes had used back-and-forth emailing to coordinate appointments with customers.
          We were able to set up tools and automation for them to efficiently manage customer intake via Calendly.

          When the customers were directed to Calendly from the website, our Zapier automation collected the Calendly form data and populated a Google sheet with relevant information: customer details, addresses, service types, and any specialized needs. 
          This information was translated into an internal dashboard that helped the managers better understand billing, customer preferences, and other metrics.
