          Rabbi Philip Lazowski is a spiritual leader and Holocaust survivor based in Connecticut.
          He has self-published several books, and was looking for a way to promote his latest, <u>Transforming Darkness into Light: A Holocaust Survivorâ€™s Lessons on Fighting Hate</u>.
          His team requested a website that would help them sell the book, as well as centralize all of his works, appearances, and stories.

          We conducted thorough research to ensure that the site was as comprehensive as possible.
          We sought out the remaining physical copies of his early works via BookFinder, 
          digitized old photographs, and developed visual maps to contextualize his survivorship story.
